# Automated Open-Source Issue Finder

**The Problem:** Finding a first open-source contribution is a major hurdle for new developers. Opportunities are scattered, and the search is a manual, time-consuming process.

**The Solution:** This project automates the entire discovery process. It acts as a dedicated service that:

* 🚀 **Scans Popular Repositories:** Queries the GitHub API across projects like `microsoft/vscode`, `facebook/react`, and `kubernetes/kubernetes` on a daily schedule.
* 🎯 **Filters for Opportunity:** Identifies and collects issues specifically labeled as `good first issue` or `help wanted`.
* 📋 **Centralizes the Data:** Compiles all findings into a single, clean list and automatically updates this README page with the results.

**The Impact:** Ultimately, this tool transforms a frustrating manual search into a reliable, automated feed, making it easier than ever to get started with open-source development.
